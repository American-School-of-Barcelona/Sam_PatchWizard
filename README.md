# m26_ia_template
A TKTKTK template project for m26 IBCS IAs


WHO: 
Çohort, Mentors


GOALS:

I want every m26 IBCS student to have a repo for their IA in this Git Hub Organization.

Permissions:

Student and Carle have commit access by default.
Project holds ENTIRE project.  Even topic pivots need to happen through branches, not new repos.

Consistent structure across all student REPOs

A consistent file structure for RECORDS.md, distinct form README.md.

Records needs to hold Narrative Record of tasks, and material like the Makerspace Planning sheet.  TODO lists. Collectionof tutorial links. Links to LLM chat transcripts. NOTES!
